This is my review of the Google Cybersecurity course from Coursera. 

I finished the certifcate this past month and while it's still fresh on my mind, figure I'd get it out there into the world. 

Overall, I found the course to be high quality. Well worth the price. I'm a Coursera Plus member, so it was included in the ~$62/month fee. 

Each course was taught by an employee at Google. It is video format, but includes notes after each topic and a Glossary at the end of each Module and Course. 

There are labs and other interactive activities to complete. Some were boring, others were at least entertaining. 

They also give you a few portfolio excercises. 

My tips for success:
This really isn't a hard course, but if you are completely new to IT, it's suggest using a note taking app such as OneNote or Obsidian. 
I try to document as much as I can, even if the information is not new. If anything, it adds reinforcement. 

Do the excercises, don't just try to fool it into completion. Again, reinforcement of what you are learning. 

They do breeze over things, again, this is an Intro or foundational course, so if you don't quite understand something...GOOGLE IT!
