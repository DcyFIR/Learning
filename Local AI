I created a local AI instance using Linux, Docker, and Ollama.
This is a brief overview of it. 

First, I used my personal Windows machine. I have WSL with Ubuntu installed already. 
If you need a guide on that, maybe I'll do one later, but it's incredibly simple to do and run. 

Once that was on, I opened my terminal and installed Ollama. 
You can find that download here: https://ollama.com/download
Note: You don't NEED Linux, they do have a Windows version, I just prefer Linux. 

Now, add a model. 
In Linux: ollama run llama3.2
The run command will download Llama3.2 if you don't already have it. 
Once it installs, it will open. 
Great!
You could be done here, but I'm going a step further. You can add a clean UI with Open WebUI.
The UI will make it look like your using ChatGPT or Gemini. 
We'll do this with Docker.

Type /bye into the model to close out or open a new terminal, your choice.

Now for Docker. 

Here is what you'll run in Terminal:
This gets the GPG Key for Docker
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

Add the repository:
echo \
"deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update

Now install Docker:
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin

Now time to kick it off:
docker run -d --network=host -v open-webui:/app/backend/data -e OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434 --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main

Now you have Open WebUI!

With Ollama running, open it up. 
http://localhost:8080/

If you want another way to verify Ollama is running, go here: http://localhost:11434/
All it will say is that it's running. 

Now have fun. To add more models, just go here and look for one that interests you, like maybe DeepSeek.
